# Happy Birthday Nina!

This is a small app I did for my niece's recent birthday (it's late by a bit),
but there are the goals of the app:

1. Has a picture of a marimba
2. Rectangles are coloured
3. When you click each rectangle, it plays a sound corresponding to the note
and it darkens the colour slightly
4. Releasing the click brings it back to normal
5. There's a button that says "Play happy birthday"
6. On click, the thing clicks the buttons in sequence for happy birthday
7. Optionally, after happy birthday is done, I want balloons to fly through the
screen


## Deployment

I'm using render.com for a continuous build and deploy of it. App is live in
happybirthdaynina.royalsflush.com
